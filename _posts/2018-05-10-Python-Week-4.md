    <td>Mr Ampah-Korsah was back in our lesson today so we had more opportunity to get help, but I didn't need it. I worked extremely well on python and focused on the objective throughout the lesson, but not earning any badges today, unfortunately.</td>

    <td>Today I feel that I didn't read the instructions and pay as much attention to the detail as python requires. I could have also persevered a little more, so I didn't get as much work done in the lesson as I should have done.</td>

    <td>Focus more on the code and realise that python is a complex code language and will not be so straightforward.</td>

    <td>Mr Ampah-Korsah was bak in our lesson today so we had more opportunity to get help, but I didn`t need it. I worked extremely well on python and focused on the objective throughout the lesson, but not earning any badges today, unfortunately.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Today I feel that I didn't read the instructions and pay as much attention to the detail as python requires. I could have also persevered a little more, so I didn't get as much work done in the lesson as I should have done.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Focus more on the code and realise that python is a complex code language and will not be so straightforward.</td>

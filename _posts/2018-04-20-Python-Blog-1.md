    <td>Listening to Mr Ampah-Korsah was extremely important during this lesson, otherwise we would have no clue what to do. After listening to instructions for a couple of minutes, we then dived straight into python. At first it was just simple typing but then it progressed into harder forms of code, like variables. Overall it was a very important lesson to remember.</td>
